\title{Check Environmental Balance of Folds}
\usage{
check_env_balance(object, ...)

\method{check_env_balance}{DataFolds}(
  object,
  covariates,
  plot_type = c("density", "boxplot"),
  n_background = 10000,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{DataFolds} object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{sample_background}.}

\item{covariates}{A \code{SpatRaster} (terra) containing environmental layers.
It must have the same coordinate reference system (CRS) as the sf objects used for blocking.}

\item{plot_type}{Character. Either "density" (default) or "boxplot".}

\item{n_background}{Numeric. Number of background points to sample for environmental
space representation. Default 10,000.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{EnvDiagnostic}.
}
\description{
Evaluates whether environmental covariates are well-balanced
across folds. It extracts values from a \code{SpatRaster} at point locations.
For large rasters, it uses a background sample to represent the study area.
}
\details{
The function calculates the \emph{Schoener's D} metric (Schoener, 1968) for continuous
variables to quantify the actual overlap in environmental space.
\itemize{
\item \strong{Schoener's D metric}: This metric ranges
from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (identical niches) and quantifies how well each fold
represents available environmental space (the background). A median value is reported
across all folds for each covariate.

\item \strong{Interpretation}: Values > 0.6 generally indicate that the folds
are representative of the study area's environmental conditions. Low values
suggest that cross-validation results may be biased because the model is being
tested on environmental conditions it rarely encountered during training.
}

The function also evaluates environmental balance using two distinct statistical
tests based on the variable type:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Continuous Variables:} A {\texit[Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum Test} is
performed to determine if the median values of the covariate differ significantly
across folds. A \eqn{p > 0.05} suggests that the folds are representative of
the same environmental niche.

\item \strong{Categorical Variables:} A \textit{Pearson's Chi-squared Test} is
conducted. To account for rare classes (e.g., specific land-cover types) and
sparse contingency tables, \eqn{p}-values are computed via \bold{Monte Carlo
simulation} (with 2,000 replicates) rather than relying on asymptotic distributions.
The Null Hypothesis (\eqn{H_0}): There is no significant difference in the frequency
distribution of categories (e.g., land cover types) across the different data folds.
If \eqn{p > 0.05} (Homogeneous): We fails to reject \eqn{H_0}, indicating that
the environment is effectively similar in every fold.
}

Both tests are used to measure the internal consistency of the distribution
of the environmental variables across the spatial folds. The rationale is to ensure
that validation metrics reflect the model's ability to generalize across the
species' niche, rather than its proximity to training data.
