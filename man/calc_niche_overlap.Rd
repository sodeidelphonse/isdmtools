\title{Calculate Niche Overlap (Schoener's D)}
\usage{
calc_niche_overlap(x, y, n = 512)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector (e.g., predictions or spatial fold values).}

\item{y}{Numeric vector (e.g., observations or background values).}

\item{n}{Numeric. Number of points for density estimation. Default 512.}
}
\value{
Numeric value between 0 and 1.
}
\description{
Computes the overlap between two distributions.

library(isdmtools)

# Create two identical distributions (should have high overlap)
