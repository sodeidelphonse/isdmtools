\title{A Toolkit for Integrated Species Distribution Models}
\description{
\code{isdmtools} provides a set of tools for preparing, analyzing and visualizing spatial data for integrated species distribution models (ISDMs).
It is designed to help users prepare multisource spatial point datasets for block cross-validation, with a focus on Bayesian inference.
It also analyse the habitat suitability from joint model predictions and map the results. The package also provides a holistic view of model performance
by computing a comprehensive evaluation metrics for the joint model, including ROC-based and continuous-outcome weighted composite scores.
