\title{A Toolkit for Integrated Species Distribution Models}
\description{
The \code{isdmtools} package provides a set of tools for preparing, evaluating and visualizing spatial data for integrated species distribution models (ISDMs).
It is designed to help users to prepare multisource spatial point datasets, in particular the spatial blocking techniques for spatial cross-validation, and
analyse the habitat suitability from joint model predictions and map the results. It also help to compute a comprehensive evaluation metrics of the joint model
performance using both ROC-based and continuous weighted composite scores providing a holistic view of model performance.
