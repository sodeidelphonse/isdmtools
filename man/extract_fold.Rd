\title{Extract a specific fold from a data partition}
\usage{
extract_fold(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object from which a spatial fold can be extracted (e.g. \code{DataFolds} object)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to specific methods.}
}
\value{
A list containing two named elements: \code{train} and \code{test}.
The structure of these elements depends on the specific method used.
For the \code{DataFolds} class, each element is a named list of \code{sf} objects,
with names corresponding to the original datasets.
}
\description{
A generic method to extract a specific fold from an object that contains
data partitions, for use in cross-validation.
}
\details{
This function is generic, meaning it provides a consistent interface for
different types of objects. The method dispatched depends on the class of the \code{object} argument.
The primary purpose is to abstract the process of accessing training and testing data for a given fold,
making it easier to write generic cross-validation loops.
