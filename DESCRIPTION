Description: A suite of tools for preparing spatial folds for block cross-validation, evaluating integrated models built from multisource spatial datasets and manipulating and visualising outputs. 
    These tools are designed to assist with building and analyzing Integrated Species Distribution Models (ISDMs) with a particular focus on the Bayesian modelling framework.
