Description: A suite of tools for for manipulating and visualising spatial data, as well as for block cross-validation and evaluating spatial models with multisource point datasets. 
    These tools are designed to assist with building and analyzing Integrated Species Distribution Models (ISDMs) with a focus on the Bayesian framework.
