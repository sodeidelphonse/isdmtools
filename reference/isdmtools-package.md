# A Toolkit for Integrated Species Distribution Models

`isdmtools` provides a set of tools for preparing, analyzing and
visualizing spatial data for integrated species distribution models
(ISDMs). It is designed to help users prepare multisource spatial point
datasets for block cross-validation, with a focus on Bayesian inference.
It analyses the habitat suitability from joint model predictions and
maps the results. The package also provides a holistic view of model
performance by computing a comprehensive evaluation metrics for the
joint model, including ROC-based and continuous-outcome weighted
composite scores.
